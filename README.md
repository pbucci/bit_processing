# bit_processing

Instructions tested on Arduino Uno and a Mac.

To run:

1) Install the Arduino IDE, Processing.org IDE, and the Processing.org Servo library.
2) Upload the 'StandardFirmata' sketch to the board. You can find it on a Mac under File > Examples > Firmata.
3) Run the Processing.org sketch. The console prints a list of available USB devices. You'll have to choose the board from the list. If you're not sure which one is the board, the Arduino IDE should be able to recognize it automatically under Tools > Port > YOUR_DEVICE.

Troubleshooting:

Unplug and replug for all known problems until further notice.
